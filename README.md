# Plug-Pass

Clatskanie People's Utility District (PUD) is a public, not-for-profic electric utility, governed by a locally-elected Board of Directors serving the Oregon communities and surrounding areas of Rainier, Westport, and Clatskanie.  The vast majority of our customers commute for work, and Clatskanie PUD designed its electric vehicle to minimize cost and maximize value for its commuting customers.  

Plug-Pass is a subscription-based, electric-vehicle public charging program developed to provide commuters easy access to low-cost charging service at their workplaces.  The first deployment of the Plug-Pass program was at a location where access to the parking spots was easily monitored, and the initial offering only used timers to control electricity.  In considering ways to expand the program to locations that aren't easily monitored, staff is developing low-cost control mechanisms to enable subscribers to initiate charging while preventing unauthorized parties from easily accessing the service.

This program is designed to be open-source in the hope that by sharing the program design broadly we may be able to expand the number of utilities employing similar techniques, and thereby lower the implementation costs for offering the program to more locations in our service territory.

Included in this repository is open-source information that has been used in our pilot program:
* Form of Electric Vehicle Public Charging Rate Design<br>
* Worksheet for calculating public charging rates<br>
* Form of Plug-Pass subscription agreement<br>
* Summary of Clatskanie PUD's Electric Vehicle Public Charging Program Design

Under development in this repository are open-source projects to be deployed and tested
* Software for arduino nano based plug-pass outlet control platform
* Control board design and configuration 
* Component list for Plug-Pass outlet
