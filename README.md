# Plug-Pass

Clatskanie PUD's Plug-Pass program is a subscription-based, electric-vehicle public charging service developed to provide commuters easy access to low-cost charging at their workplaces.

Clatskanie PUD is a public, not-for-profic electric utility, governed by a locally-elected Board of Directors serving the Oregon communities and surrounding areas of Rainier, Westport, and Clatskanie.  The vast majority of our customers commute for work, and Clatskanie PUD designed its electric vehicle to minimize cost and maximize value for its commuting customers.
